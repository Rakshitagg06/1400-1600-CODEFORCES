## ðŸ’¡ Key Idea / Approach

Explain the core idea of the solution in your own words.
* The idea was like this : first it is better to iterate from end , then ex-> 5 2, then break 5 into {1,2,2} , there is a k for splitting and number of such splits is (k-1) summation for all i, also a[i] changes to 1(or a[i]/k)
